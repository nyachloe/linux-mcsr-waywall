# OBS

- If you want to install OBS on your system, you can proceed with this section of the instructions.
- Open up a terminal and type in this command
```bash
sudo dnf install obs-studio
```
- This should download and install OBS on your system.
- **DO NOT** download it with software manager. This uses flatpak which is generally less preferred.
- After downloading and installing it, you can open it and set it up as per usual.
- If you are using classic wall (without SeedQueue) you might want to look at [these](https://github.com/tesselslate/resetti/blob/legacy-wall/doc/obs.md) docs to setup OBS to work with resetti.
