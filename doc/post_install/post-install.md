# Post Install

The following chapters will guide you through the post installation procedure of installing Linux for MCSR.

# Software Manager

- The software manager is the best place for you to search and install packages and apps.
- If you cannot find any package on it for some reason, Googling about it is your best friend. If Google doesn't have an answer for it too, then you can ask in [here](https://discord.gg/3tm4UpUQ8t).

# Update Cycle
- Fedora usually doesn't remind you or bug you to update your packages over and over.
- Our recommendation is for you to follow a **automatic** update schedule, i.e., make sure to turn on automatic updates in kde settings.
- This is just to make sure you don't run into any problems and to get the latest software for your system as early as possible.
