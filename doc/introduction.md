# Introduction

The instructions given below will be the pre-install setup. By the end of it, you will have a bootable USB stick with KDE Fedora installed on it.

# Distributions

- Linux, being a **free and open source operating system**, comes in several different flavours a.k.a distributions a.k.a distros.
- Some of the popular distributions are **Ubuntu**, **Fedora**, **Arch Linux(btw)**, etc.
- For MCSR, we recommend a distribution based on **RHEL** called **Fedora**. For waywall, we recommend using the **KDE Plasma** variation of **Fedora**.
- Make sure to go **[here](https://fedoraproject.org/kde/download)** and click the ISO file under **For Intel and AMD x86_64 systems**. This is what we will be using to flash the USB.
- You can learn more about **Linux Distributions** [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution).

# Flashing KDE Fedora

- After downloading the distribution ISO from the official Fedora Project website, pick up a USB stick of at least 4GB space or above.
- **NOTE: The USB stick will be formatted during the install process and all data on it will be erased. This can be worked around by using [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) Instead.**
- To install the ISO into the USB stick, follow the guide for **Fedora Media Writer** listed on the [aforementioned website](https://fedoraproject.org/kde/download)

# Moving Ahead

- Make sure to have Secure Boot disabled in your motherboard settings and make sure to have CSM/BIOS mode disabled before you proceed to other sections.
- Now we start with the difficult part of the installation. We make decisions based more on your PC configuration. So make sure to follow through the instructions very carefully.
