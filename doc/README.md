# Linux MCSR

- A documentation repository to help setting up Linux for MCSR.
- This is a fork from Saanvi's (slightly oudated) resetti / x11 mcsr guide. Her original documentation can be found [here](https://its-saanvi.github.io/linux-mcsr/).
# Getting Started

- The instructions start from the very basics and explain each step verbosely. Feel free to skip some steps if you know what you are doing.
- You can get started right [here](introduction.md).
- If you aren't sure whether to use resetti or waywall, there is no shame in getting support from the [linux mcsr community](https://discord.gg/3tm4UpUQ8t).
