# NinjabrainBot

- Download the .jar for NinjabrainBot as per usual from [here](https://github.com/Ninjabrain1/Ninjabrain-Bot/releases/latest).
- Since we are using waywall, all we need to do is put the file somewhere where it wont be moved (eg. ~/Desktop/.MCSR).
- We will be launching ninjabrain bot through our waywall config. We just need to specify a path to the jar file.
