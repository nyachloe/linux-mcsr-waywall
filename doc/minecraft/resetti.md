# Waywall
## Using SeedQueue with waywall
- This is the Single Instance Macro we would be using to run alongside [SeedQueue](https://github.com/kingcontaria/seedqueue). This would mainly be used to configure and manage your alternate resolutions and add mirrors similar to using obs projectors. You can refer to SeedQueue's setup video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGu2MYZxh_c).
- Go to [this](http://tesselslate.github.io/waywall/) link if you need the waywall docs.

## Using classic wall with resetti
- If you would like to run resetti with its Wall features still, you can look [here](https://github.com/tesselslate/resetti/releases/tag/v0.6.1) to download the binary for the last stable wall release of resetti.
- After downloading, do the same steps as listed in the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th points under `Using SeedQueue with resetti` above.
- You can run the macro now same as above using `./resetti <profile_name>` in a terminal.
- You would need to configure everything the same way as before but you'd have to take a lot of extra steps as listed clearly [here](https://github.com/tesselslate/resetti/blob/main/doc/README.md).


If you have any questions, feel free to join the [resetti discord](https://discord.gg/fwZA2VJh7k) and make a thread in the `help` channel there.
